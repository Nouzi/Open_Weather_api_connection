### This is my atempt to create simple connection to Open Weather API via laravel and their http client. 

### When you install this aplication and run "php artisan serve" you will be able to type any state or city and will get some of the data about weather there. Main point in doing this is for someone else to complete view part of the data. Since connection is already established and you don't need to worry about that part.

#### PS: do not forget to first create your account on open weather and create your api key. Then insert here : https://github.com/Nouzi/Open_Weather_api_connection/blob/main/app/Http/Controllers/WeatherApi.php
